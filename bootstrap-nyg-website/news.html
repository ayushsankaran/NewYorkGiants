                                 <h3>NY Giants Did Not Overpay When Signing Kenny Golladay <small>Luis Tirado - July 10, 2011</small></h3>

                              <p>As they say in life, if you want to make money, you need to spend money. Such is the case with the NY Giants as they spent a good amount of money in free agency to bolster their team. Taking that famous saying in life about money, it’s also true when it comes to NFL teams. If you want to be a contender, a team capable of doing some serious damage in the NFL Playoffs, you need to spend money on top free agents that can come in and immediately help the cause.<br><br>The Giants did exactly that when it came to strengthening their wide receiver corps. They knew, if they’re to fix an area of opportunity on offense when it came to wide receivers actually scoring touchdowns, they needed to spend money on the top free agent available. Someone who has a proven track record of scoring in the heat of the moment, experienced, and that should gel well with the Giants’ offense. Enter Kenny Golladay.<br><br>Big Blue acted quickly in free agency to land Golladay as they came to terms on a four-year, $72M contract with $40M of that guaranteed just for him to sign his name. That’s a lot of money to invest into someone whom the Giants believe can be an instant playmaker on an offense that was in dire need of a wide receiver to step up and bring fear against opposing defenses.<br><br><h4>The NY Giants made the right decision with Kenny Golladay</h4><br>Considering everything, did the Giants overpay to acquire the services of Golladay? Interestingly enough, Bleacher Report recently wrote an article breaking down every NFL team’s most overpaid player entering the 2021 season. Golladay made the list when it came to the section on the Giants.<br>In the grand scheme of things, the Giants undoubtedly needed to do something big to improve their offense. Even with their offensive draft picks, that still requires time for proper development and progression, which can easily take a few years at best. At least with Golladay, they’re bringing in a proven wide receiver that is more than capable to make big plays, score touchdowns, and be an influence in the locker room for the upcoming season.<br>Yes, there is definitely a risk since Golladay does have a history of injuries involving his hip, hamstring, and chest but if he’s able to stay healthy, will definitely be a difference-maker on offense. Considering that in his tenure with the Detroit Lions he was able to total over 3,000 receiving yards and 21 touchdowns goes to show that he’s more than likely going to be an x-factor on the Giants’ offense.<br><br>Winning fixes everything and always comes at a price. The Giants paid all that money for Golladay and considering what he brings to the table right off the bat, no, they did not overpay for him. Once he steps foot on the field in football games that actually matter and starts to score touchdowns as he’s done so many times already in the past with the Lions, fans will soon realize that he was undoubtedly worth every dollar.
