                              <p>The New York Football Giants were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara, who paid $500 for the franchise. He stated that "any team in the city of New York was worth that much." It was an oddity at the time for a team to be located in such a large city in the NFL as many clubs were located in towns such as Toledo, OH, Pottsville, PA, Decatur, IL and Canton, OH.In 1926, the team was close to bankruptcy and was saved only when the Giants hosted the Bears before 70,000 who paid to see Chicago’s Red Grange. The club rebounded and won the NFL Championship in only its third season.At the time, every NFL club introduced their offensive players before every game. Around 1956, the franchise became known for its defensive stars, such as linebacker Sam Huff and defensive end Rosey Grier. This marked the first time fans put more emphasis on the defense and would chant "De-fense, de-fense, de-fense" during games. This was the first NFL team to do this.In the 1980s, the team drafted LB Lawrence Taylor who would go on to become one of the game’s greatest defensive forces. Other notable players are Frank Gifford, Eli Manning, Y.A. Tittle, Harry Carson, Mel Hein, Fran Tarkenton, Roosevelt Brown and Phil Simms.In 1970 when the NFL merged with the AFL, it was decided that the two AFL teams which shared a geographic region, the Jets and the Raiders, would have to be relocated. Wellington Mara, Tim Mara’s son who was now running the Giants, suggested that the Jets were too entrenched and were now a viable part of New York. Therefore, the Jets were allowed to remain in New York.Tim Mara originally named the team after the National League baseball Giants, who were a longtime favorite in New York. At the time, baseball was the king of professional sports so owner Tim Mara wanted the same name recognition in hopes that fans would support both clubs. By the way, the baseball Giants got their name from all the giant buildings that made up New York City.The franchise has won eight NFL titles (third most), four of which are Super Bowls. One note of interest: in all four Super Bowl victories, the Giants were losing at halftime.<br><br><b><u>Origin Facts</b></u>:<br>Established: 1925<br>Original Owner: Tim Mara<br>Original Colors: Royal blue, red & white<br>First Stadium: Polo Grounds, seating 55,000<br>Retired Jerseys: No. 1 Ray Flaherty, No. 7 Mel Hein, No. 50 Ken Strong, No. 4 Tuffy Leemans, No. 32 Al Blozis, No. 42 Charlie Conerly, No. 16 Frank Gifford, No. 40 Joe Morrison, No. 14 Y.
