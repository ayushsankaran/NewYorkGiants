                              <p>Super Bowl week is finally here.The New York Giants may not have come close of reaching the Super Bowl this season, but they established themselves as a marquee franchise by coming up big throughout Super Bowl Sunday’s history.The Giants showcase a 4-1 record in the Super Bowl and some were one of the most memorable games of all-time. Their 20-19 victory over the Bills in Super Bowl 25 is considered one of the best games ever played, as is their 17-14 victory over the 18-0 New England Patriots in Super Bowl 42, which is also considered one of the biggest upset in sports history.The Super Bowl has also been a stage in which Eli Manning established himself as a clutch quarterback by leading his team to two fourth-quarter comebacks, resulting in a pair of Super Bowl MVPs.They’ve also accomplished some unique history that you may or may not know.<br><br>Here are four unique Super Bowl facts about the New York Giants:<br><br>The only team to win a Super Bowl in each of the last four decades. There are franchises with more Super Bowls than the Giants (Steelers, Cowboys, 49ers, Patriots), but none of them were able to win a Super Bowl in four consecutive decades.The Giants have won Super Bowls in the 1980s (SB 21), 1990s (SB 25), 2000s (SB 42), and in the 2010s (SB 46).Everyone knows you can’t win a championship every year, but winning at least one championship in a decade is a realistic goal and expectation of ownership and the fan base. Over the last four decades, the Giants are the only team in the four major sports to accomplish this feat.<br><br>Trailed at halftime in each of their five Super Bowl appearances
While the Giants have won four Super Bowls, they’ve gotten off to slow starts as they trailed at halftime in each of their five Super Bowl appearances.<br><br>
Trailed 10-9 at halftime of Super Bowl 21 against the Broncos
Trailed 12-10 at halftime of Super Bowl 25 against the Bills
Trailed 10-0 at halftime of Super Bowl 35 against the Ravens
Trailed 7-3 at halftime of Super Bowl 42 against the Patriots
Trailed 10-9 at halftime of Super Bowl 46 against the Patriots<br><br>
With the exception of Super Bowl 35, the Giants came back to win the game. This goes to show the excellent job that Bill Parcells and Tom Coughlin and each coaching staff did to make the necessary halftime adjustments to turn the game in their favor.<br><br>Every Super Bowl they won, they played their Super Bowl opponent in the regular season.<br>Each time the Giants won the Super Bowl, their opponents were a familiar foe. The Giants also faced them in the regular season.<br><br>1986 defeated the Denver Broncos 19-16 in Week 12<br>
1990 lost to Buffalo Bills 17-13 in Week 15<br>
2007 lost to New England Patriots 38-35 in Week 17<br>
2011 defeated the New England Patriots 24-20 in Week 9<br><br>The lone time they played in the Super Bowl and did not face their opponent in the regular season was Super 35 when they were defeated 34-7 by the Baltimore Ravens.<br><br>
Tom Coughlin is the oldest coach to win a Super Bowl<br><br>
With their 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 46, Tom Coughlin became the oldest coach to ever win a Super Bowl at 65 years old. Bill Belichick will surpass Coughlin and become the oldest coach to win a Super Bowl (66) if the Patriots defeat the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl 53.
If New York Giants fans needed a reason to have a vested rooting interest in Super Bowl 53, it will be that the Rams beat the Patriots so that Coughlin can keep this record.
